# 👋 Welcome to my Side Projects Notebook! 👩‍🔬🖥 </>
A fun fact about me is that I almost became a scientist! 👩‍🔬 Life led me down different paths, but I still enjoy conducting experiments occasionally...But now, instead of test tubes, I use VS Code!<br><br>
📒 This repository is like my lab notebook. It contains a summary of my main study projects and other information related to my evolution as a developer.
<br>
<br> 
> *"There will always be the next level, so #NeverStopLearning"*.
<br>
💡 *I love to share my knowledge with others, then I hope this repository can be useful and inspire someone to reach their next level too*.<br><br>
