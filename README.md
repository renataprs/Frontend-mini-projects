## About

This repository contains a summary of all my study projects and other information in relation to my evolution.
With a high emphasis on front-end development, I'll work on a few JavaScript-based Web/Mobile projects, with a pinch of UI-UX design.<br>
<br> 
> Design is my passion, coding is my superpower. My main goal is to create unique solutions joining both skills.<br><br>

## My Motivation ü§©

*"It's always a good time to take your skills to the next level"*. This sentence is my philosophy and I want to improve my coding skills all the time. I believe that take mini-projects is a good way to consistently improve your abilities and push yourself to the next level. That's why I love this method.
Besides that, I love to share my knowledge with others, then I hope this repository can be useful and inspire someone to reach their next level too.
