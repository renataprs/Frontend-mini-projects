📒 This repository is like a special lab notebook, housing my study projects and showcasing my growth as a developer.
<br>
A fun fact about me is that I almost became a scientist! 👩‍🔬 <br> 
Life led me down different paths, but I still enjoy conducting experiments occasionally...But now, instead of test tubes, I use VS Code!<br><br>
> *"There will always be the next level, so #NeverStopLearning"*.

💡 *I love to share my knowledge with others, then I hope you find something here that sparks your interest and inspires you. Feel free to provide feedback or collaborate with me on any ideas. Happy coding!*. ✨ <br><br>
