# 👋 Welcome to my Front-end Notebook! 👩‍🔬🖥 </>
Yeah! I'm always conducting experiments during my learning journey. So, this repository is like a lab notebook.<br>

It contains a summary of all my study projects and other information in relation to my evolution as a front-end developer. The learning journey never ends and collecting small victories is a great way to keep motivation strong.
<br>
<br> 
> *"It's always a good time to take your skills to the next level"*. This quote is my philosophy and I want to improve my coding skills all the time. I believe that take mini-projects is a good way to consistently improve abilities and push yourself to the next level. That's why I love learning by doing.
Besides that, **I love to share my knowledge with others, then I hope this repository can be useful and inspire someone to reach their next level too** 🤩.<br><br>
